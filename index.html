                My name is Yurim Maeng from South Korea. when I was 19 years old, I came to the US to study
                abroad in the
                university. My major was Finance. Since I was nominated as a honor student and got deanâ€™s
                lists,
                I desired to
                study in the better school and finally I made an decision to transfer to the University of
                Indiana, Bloomington,
                which is the more famous as the business school. Unlike California good weather, since the
                weather was too
                cloudy, snowy, and cold, I had the depression and insomnia. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However I could learn much better
                    things from the
                    school and meet many good intentional friends from Pakistan, India, Philippine, and China.
                    Because they love
                    K-POP and K-Drama, they can speak some Korean words and Korean food. we traveled to New York
                    for
                    thanksgiving
                    day and ate Korean food and other countries food together in the dorm.
                    After I graduated in 2018 summer, I could get a job immediately and came to
                    Torrance to work for
                    Amazon
                    Marketing Company, which was very interested in learning about Marketing and
                    Amazon System.
                    the company
                    was established 2 years ago, so there is no foundation and unstable to earn
                    money. So I changed
                    the job to the
                    logistic company, which is more stable. Now I am still working in the
                    logistic company in
                    Cerritos. I am so
                    happy to study coding for financial stabilty and career change for my better
                    future.
